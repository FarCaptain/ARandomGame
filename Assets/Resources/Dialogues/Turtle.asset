  sentences:
  - 
  - Howdy! I'm Jack the flying turtle!
  - What do you mean by why I can fly? I'm a turtle.
  - Anyways, kiddo, if you were to go through that portal, this might be helpful
    to you...
  - There is a cookie under the flower tree near the portal, which might come in
    handy when you come across that pesky ostrich later - that dude won't listen
    to you whatsoever.
  - But don't use it just yet; you want to keep it till you meet him. The cookie
    is a powerful item, but so is it disposable. And whatever magic it granted, it
    won't last for long.
  - Mark my words, and good luck. Remember, there is no coming back once you entered
    the portal!
