  - 
  - Howdy! I'm Jack the flying turtle!
  - What do you mean why I can fly? I'm a turtle.
  - Anyways, if you were to go through that portal...
  - There is a cookie under the flower tree near the portal, which might come in
    handy when you come across that pesky ostrich later - that dude won't listen
    to you whatsoever.
  - But don't use it just yet. The cookie is a powerful item, but it is also dangerous.
    Don't rely on it. And whatever magic it granted, it won't last for long.
  - Mark my words, and good luck. Remember, there is no coming back once you entered
    the portal!
